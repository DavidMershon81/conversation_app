# Anonymous Conversation App

This is a prototype for an anonymous conversation system. I built this as kind of a combination UX experiment and excuse to learn some full stact React development using a python back end.

While I learned a lot about react engineering from working on this, I think the back end is probably seriously insecure, and were I to revisit it, I would want to think a lot more about authentication, authorization and user account management.
